# CellContact
CellContact is a MATLAB-based statistical framework to detect cell contact-dependent gene expression. This is a new framework to analyze spatial transcriptomics (ST) data using spatial beads composed of muliple cell types, especially for Slide-seq data with 10 µm resolution.

CellContact performs four steps as follows:

STEP1: Converting log-normalized data to z-values<br>
STEP2: Creating the null model of artificial heterotypic spots<br>
STEP3: Finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs)<br>
SETP4: Plotting heatmaps<br>
