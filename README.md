# CellContact
CellContact is a MATLAB-based statistical framework to detect cell contact-dependent gene expression. This is a new framework to analyze spatial transcriptomics (ST) data using spatial beads composed of muliple cell types, especially for Slide-seq data with 10 µm resolution.

CellContact performs four steps as follows:

STEP1: Converting log-normalized data to z-values

STEP2: Creating the null model of artificial heterotypic spots

STEP3: Finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

SETP4: Plotting heatmaps
